README

Experiments are organized in individual folders based on the NGS screen, i.e. "uASPIRE screen 1-5". Each folder contains the processed data in the subfolder 'data' and one or multiple R scripts to analyze the data. 
When running the R scripts consecutively, folders will be generated containing plots (under 'plots') and the results of some analyses including data tables (under 'results').
Subsequently, plots and tables shown in the manuscript can be traced back using the table 'Figure_trace_back' and 'Table_trace_back', respectively. In these tables, the source of the individual plots/tables is specified, i.e. the experiment and the script with which they were created.
